# Backlog — Remaining Work

**Last updated:** 2026-03-14
**Context:** Consolidated from all completed planning docs. Items prioritized by impact and dependency.

---

## P0 — Blockers / Critical

### 1. Agent Flow Orchestration Engine (Phase 3H)
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--plan--agent-task-mcp-wiring.md`
**What:** Agent flows exist as data model only — no background worker to progress phases, enforce gates, or handle delegation. Largest remaining architecture gap.
**Status:** NOT STARTED

### 2. ACP Agents Get No MCP Servers
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--review--ui-backend-capability-gaps.md` (F5)
**What:** `harness.rs` passes `mcp_servers: vec![]` to Gemini/Qwen sessions. Non-Claude agents can't use any tools.
**Status:** NOT STARTED

---

## P1 — Major / High Impact

### 3. Unify MCP Config Systems
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--review--ui-backend-capability-gaps.md` (F9)
**What:** Settings > MCP Servers configures Claude Code CLI's `~/.claude.json`. The executor pipeline reads `default_mcp.json`. Completely separate — confusing for users.

### 4. Workflow Trigger System
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--review--ui-backend-capability-gaps.md` (F12)
**What:** Workflows must be manually run. No cron, event, or webhook triggers.

### 5. E2E Demo Test Run
**Source:** `2026-03-14--plan--e2e-demo-refactor.md`
**What:** 25 demo tests committed and parse correctly but haven't been run yet against the live app. Need to verify all pass in headed mode with single persistent browser.
**Status:** PENDING FIRST RUN

---

## P1.5 — Notification & Demo Enhancements

### Notification Quick Action Buttons (Future Sprint)
**Source:** 2026-03-15 dogfood session
**What:** Add quick action buttons to notification items so users can take the next workflow step directly from the notification dropdown (e.g., "Approve" staged records, "Review PR", "Mark Done"). Reduces context switching.
**Status:** NOT STARTED — deferred to future sprint

### Demo Script Improvements
**Source:** 2026-03-15 dogfood session
**What:** Add better context/narration to demo scripts — annotations explaining what each step demonstrates, why it matters. Currently the demos work but don't convey the product story.
**Status:** PARTIALLY DONE — workflow CRM demo extended with Parts 5-8 (approve, runs tab, CRM contacts, pipeline). Bug report + manual QA demos still need narration.

---

## P2 — Medium / UX Polish

### 6. AgentWatcherPanel Error State
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-13--review--dogfood-e2e-qa.md` (Bug #3)
**What:** Shows "No agent reviewers" instead of error message when API fails.

### 7. DbUuid Phase 3 — Remaining Model Conversions
**Source:** `notes/2026-03-14--reference--dbuuid-phase3-remaining.md`
**What:** ~107 models still use `Uuid`. Phase 1-2 complete — unblocked agent endpoints. Phase 3 removes bridge code and prevents future BLOB/TEXT mismatches.
**Effort:** High volume, low risk per file. Batch by domain.

### 8. Agent "View Profile" Link
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--tracker--sprint1-issues.md` (item 7)
**What:** Backend `GET /api/agents/:id/profile` works. No frontend link on agent cards.

### 9. `http_request` Node Guardrails
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--tracker--sprint1-issues.md`
**What:** No OAuth/auth token management, no URL allowlisting, no rate limiting. Security concern for production.

### 10. Rename "Bug Triage Pipeline"
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-13--review--dogfood-e2e-qa.md` (Bug #12)
**What:** Feature requests processed by "Bug Triage Pipeline" — should be "Feedback Triage Pipeline".

### 11. ~~No Success Toast for Feedback Submission~~ → RESOLVED
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-13--review--dogfood-e2e-qa.md` (Bug #4)
**Resolution:** FeedbackDialog now uses toast (commit `7cd4b22c9`)

### 12. Project Task Count Doesn't Auto-Refresh
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-13--review--dogfood-e2e-qa.md` (Bug #5)
**What:** After feedback creates a task, the sidebar project task count is stale until page refresh.

---

## P3 — Low Priority / Future Sprints

### 13. Schema Improvements for Dogfood Pipeline
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-13--plan--dogfood-pipeline-activation.md`
- Add `qa` status to distinguish QA review from human approval on kanban
- Add `deployed` status to distinguish "code merged" from "manually done"
- Add `task_id` FK on `merges` table for direct task→PR lookup
- Add `task_status_history` table for full audit trail

### 14. Sprint 2-3 Roadmap Items
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--plan--three-sprint-roadmap.md`
- Convert hardcoded automations to editable system workflows
- Bulk task operations (select multiple, batch status change)
- Progress indicator for agent execution on task cards
- Undo reject / re-open task workflow

### 15. Known Limitations (Design Choices)
- Conditional node: only simple string matching + `count>N`
- CRM update nodes: match by email/name only (no fuzzy matching)
- ACP MCP loading: path depends on server working directory
- Task FTS search index: auto-sync triggers dropped — needs app-level reindexing

### 16. UI Polish — Future Improvements
- Task card inline editing
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Board column WIP limits
- Workflow versioning/history
- Mobile user menu shortcut (avatar in navbar)
- View-as keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+V)
- Sidebar section animated transitions
- Settings tab URL persistence

### 17. React Router v7 Migration Warnings
**Source:** `archive/2026-03-12--review--sprint1-qa-results.md`
- Future flag deprecation warnings in console
- `validateDOMNesting` warning (button nested in button in workflow editor)

## TODO — Manual Verification

- [ ] Edit Task / Feedback / Project Form dialogs: verify sticky footer
- [ ] ResizableDrawer: drag resize, expand/collapse, click-outside-to-close
- [ ] Fullscreen BreadcrumbNav visible, Esc to close
- [ ] Start dev server → Settings > Agents → agents load (no 500)
- [ ] Create Task → Agent picker → agents listed
- [ ] Task detail → Agent Watcher panel → no 500 errors
- [ ] Run E2E demos headed: `FRONTEND_PORT=3001 npx playwright test --project=demos`
