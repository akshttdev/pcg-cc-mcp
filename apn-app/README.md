# APN Core - Alpha Protocol Network Desktop Client

## Overview

**APN Core** is the lightweight desktop client for contributing computational resources to the Alpha Protocol Network. Think of it as the "workhorse" that empowers the network.

### Key Components:

1. **Pythia Master Node** (192.168.1.77)
   - Unique orchestrator node
   - Holds the source of Pythia AI
   - Coordinates all computational resources
   - Directs work to APN Core clients

2. **APN Core Clients** (This application)
   - Contribute CPU, RAM, GPU, Storage
   - Execute tasks assigned by Pythia
   - Lightweight desktop application
   - Show network status and contribution metrics

3. **PCG Dashboard** (Web application)
   - End-user application built ON TOP of the network
   - Utilizes the computational power provided by APN
   - Separate from APN Core

## What APN Core Does

### Contributions:
- ✅ Provides computational resources to the network
- ✅ Executes distributed tasks
- ✅ Participates in mesh networking
- ✅ Reports system capabilities

### Monitoring:
- 📊 View your contribution stats
- 🌐 See other nodes in the network
- 💰 Track VIBE token earnings (Auto-distributed every 5 minutes!)
- 📈 Monitor system resource usage

### 💰 VIBE Rewards System:
- **Automatic Earnings:** Get paid in VIBE for being online
- **Heartbeat Rewards:** 0.1 VIBE base per heartbeat (every 30s)
- **Multipliers:** 2x for GPU, 1.5x for high CPU, 1.3x for high RAM
- **On-Chain:** All rewards distributed on Aptos blockchain
- **No Action Needed:** Just run the app and earn!

**See [SETUP-REWARDS.md](SETUP-REWARDS.md) for complete reward configuration guide.**

## Running APN Core

### Prerequisites:
- Rust toolchain installed
- Node.js and npm installed
- Network access to Pythia Master Node (192.168.1.77)

### Development:
```bash
cd apn-app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### Production Build:
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

### Connecting to Pythia:
The app automatically connects to:
- **NATS Relay:** nats://nonlocal.info:4222 (for peer discovery and heartbeats)
- **Master Node API:** http://192.168.1.77:58297 (for reward tracking)

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you're running the latest code from the `new` branch:
```bash
git checkout new
git pull origin new
cd apn-app
npm run tauri build
```

## Features

### Resource Contribution
Your device contributes:
- CPU cores for computation
- RAM for temporary storage
- GPU for accelerated processing (if available)
- Storage space for distributed data

### Network Visibility
See all nodes orchestrated by Pythia:
- Node IDs and capabilities
- Real-time resource stats
- Connection status
- Task completion metrics

### Security
- Ed25519 keypair identity
- Encrypted communication (libp2p Noise protocol)
- Recovery phrase for node identity
- No sensitive data transmitted

## Architecture Notes

**APN Core clients are NOT master nodes.**

They are worker nodes that:
- Receive instructions from Pythia
- Execute computational tasks
- Report back results and status
- Contribute to the collective computational power

**Pythia** is the single orchestrator that:
- Coordinates all work distribution
- Manages resource allocation
- Ensures network efficiency
- Holds the AI decision-making core

## Relationship to PCG Dashboard

```
APN Core (this app) → Provides compute power
                 ↓
        Pythia Master Node → Orchestrates
                 ↓
        PCG Dashboard → Uses compute power for applications
```

**APN Core** is infrastructure.
**PCG Dashboard** is the application layer.
